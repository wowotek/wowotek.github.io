# Do i really have that low pride?

![egowarning](egowarning.jpg)

Oh god i really do love my Aurelia so much. but she always be like that. what should i say ? a jerk ? that's a strong word, but for lack of better words, imma go with that
just for quick example, i'm going to talk about what just happened

> A : Yeah but it's taking too long waiting for you to reply <br/>
> &ensp; : If you feeling wasted or sleepy. it's ok, just go to sleep <br/>
> &ensp; : it's bettery than waiting you to long to reply <br/>
> &ensp; : and suddenly, you'll gone sleeping. leaving me

This literally just happened _--for future me, this is 05/06/2019--_ today is Eid Al-Mubarak, the happy day, and also a long day.
meeting neighbours, cousins, brothers, sisters. the point is, i met a lot of people.
But i should take note here. really **Boldly**. **There is only 2 of us** me and my mom. we work hard to please our guests. **Real Hard**. The Eid Al-Shalat is attended at 7:00 AM, and finished at 8:00 AM and i haven't stop working since, until i wrote this.

> W : *laughing* alrighty<br/>
> &ensp; : i'm going to sleep

> A : you're such an annoying

> W : I'm Sorry

> A : Ya


Finally, i have time to talk to my lovely girlfriend of mine. so i chat her.
the chat goes normally, until i go to the bathroom to pee. yeah _**PEE**_. and she just straight away mad at me. she doesn't want me to stop at all. even a single minute or even second.
she just want to chat all day long. she mad at me. she don't want to talk all day long tommorow _--well in this context, today--_.

> W : I just don't want to you to feel lonely, bad, or anything

> A : That's Not Necessary, i'm irritated already.

what have i done? i feel like i did nothing wrong. does she need to be like that? does she need to be that egoistic, and selfish? i love her so much, but not like this.
i fell i have to do something. like, i need to take my step.
i'm not that kind of person who can be crushed by some egoistic girl. but i don't know what to do, or atleast, how to do it.

> A : Just leave me alone tommorow. don't chat me <br/>
> &ensp; : if you'd still chat me and keep missing and didn't reply for so long

yes. i need to do something about this.
